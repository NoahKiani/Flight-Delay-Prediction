This project involves all steps I took in my personal project. My personal project was to predict arrival delays of flights across the USA. This prediction will be based on a dataset provided by te US government and contains a complete flight summary. In the folder Notebooks you can find all notebooks I used. The index after the name indicates the order which you should open them, to follow my steps chronologically.
